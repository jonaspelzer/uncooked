###HELP

####It doesn’t work!
If your customization options don’t show in the preview, it should help to deactivate and reactivate them. Also, try to deactivate and reactivate Apply Theme Option Styles.

####Reset to browser defaults
If you want to reset to browser defaults, simply deactivate Apply Theme Option Styles.

####Custom font
If you want to use a custom font, choose one from [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com). If the name consists of one word only, type the name into the fields *Google Web Font Name* and *Google Web Font Name with Pluses*. If the font name consists of multiple words, type the name into the field *Google Web Font Name*, e.g. *IBM Plex Sans Condensed* and the same name with pluses into the field *Google Web Font Name with Pluses*, e.g. *IBM+Plex+Sans+Condensed*.
